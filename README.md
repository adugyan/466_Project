Wb application implemented using PHP and CSS contains:
• a page that allows a user to specify an artist, song title, or contributor to search for

• a page that shows the songs that match the criteria from the above page. Show all
versions of each song found. The user can choose a version of the song and enter into either of
the queues. If he or she chooses the accelerated queue, it will inquire if they are willing to add a tip.

• a page that shows the queues for the DJ. Using this page, the DJ is able to flag songs as already
played once he has called the users up to perform. The already-performed songs will no longer show in the
queue, but will remain present in the database.
